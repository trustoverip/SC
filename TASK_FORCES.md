# ToIP Foundation Task Forces

A Task Force is a lightweight informal self-organization mechanism that does not require a formal JDF charter. A Foundation-wide TF can be formed directly under the [Steering Committee (SC)][https://lists.trustoverip.org/g/steering-committee], and a Working Group TF can be formed under any WG. A TF requires a wiki page but any other formal mechanisms or approvals are optional.


## Bootstrapping a Task Force

The process for creating a new Task Force is as follows:

1. [Submit a draft charter](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/How+to+Propose+a+New+Working+Group+or+Task+Force) to the SC.
2. Once the SC ratifies a charter the TF will inherit the following
    1. Access to a new ToIP GitHub repository using the convention: ```trustoverip/XXXXXXX-taskforce````.
    2. Access to an appropriate LICENSE
    3. Starter templates for a [WG repository basics](https://github.com/trustoverip/admin/repo_basics)

      1. Governance
      2. Code of Conduct
      3. Moderation Policy
      4. Meeting Minutes
      5. Call to Action

The TF is free to change these documents through their own governance process, hence the term "bootstrap."
