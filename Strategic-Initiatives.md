# Strategic Initiatives

At any one time the ToIP Foundation project may have a number of strategic initiatives
underway.  The goal of the SC is to have a champion for each of these initiatives and to support the initiatives in order to enable their success.

A review of the initiatives will be a standing item on the SC agenda (even if the update is 'nothing new') as a way to ensure they are active and have the support needed.
