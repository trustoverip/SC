### ToIP Steering Committee

The ToIP Steering Committee (SC) is responsible for high-level guidance of the project, working groups, task forces and repositories associated with the ToIP Foundation. .

The WG has final authority over this project including:

* Technical direction
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators

### Collaborators

The ToIP Steering Committee GitHub repository is
maintained by the SC.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These individuals are identified by the WG and their addition as Collaborators is discussed during the weekly WG meeting.

_Note:_ If you make a significant contribution and are not considered for commit-access log an issue or contact a WG member directly and it will be brought up in the next WG meeting.

Modifications of the contents of the ToIP Steering Committee repository are made on a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators
participate and there is disagreement around a particular
modification. See _Consensus Seeking Process_ below for further detail on the consensus model used for governance.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the WG for discussion by assigning the ***WG-agenda*** tag to a pull request or issue. The WG should serve as the final arbiter where required.

For the current list of Collaborators, see the project
[README.md](./README.md#current-project-team-members).

### SC Membership

Membership in the Steering Committee is governed by the ToIP Participation Agreement.  

### SC Meetings

SC Meetings SHOULD be:

* Published to the organization Wiki or YouTube channel.
* Captured in the ```meetings``` directory using the SC's [meeting template](./meetings/YYYY-MM-DD.md).

Prior to each WG meeting the moderator will share the Agenda with members of the SC. SC members can add any items they like to the agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the SC cannot veto or remove items.

The SC may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to participate in a non-voting capacity.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.
