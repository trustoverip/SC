# ToIP Foundation Steering Committee
The Steering Committee (SC) is the top-level governing body
governing body of the [ToIP Foundation](http://trustoverip.org) which adheres to the organization's [governance polices](GOVERNANCE.md).

## SC Scope

**The SC is responsible for the ToIP Foundation project** as outlined and scoped in the [SC Charter][SC_Charter.md].

### List of SC Responsibilities

The SC exercises autonomy in setting up and maintaining procedures, policies,
and management and administrative structures as it deems appropriate for the
maintenance and operation of these projects and resources.

Included in the responsibilities of the SC are:

* Managing code and documentation creation and changes for the listed projects
  and resources
* Setting and maintaining standards covering contributions of code,
  documentation and other materials
* Managing code and binary releases: types, schedules, frequency, delivery
  mechanisms
* Making decisions regarding dependencies of the ToIP Foundation project,
  including what those dependencies are and how they are bundled with source
  code and releases
* Creating new repositories and projects under the _trustoverip_ GitHub organization
  as required
* Setting overall technical direction for the ToIP Foundation project, including
  high-level goals and low-level specifics regarding features and functionality
* Setting and maintaining appropriate standards for community discourse via the
  various mediums under SC control
* Setting and maintaining governance rules for the conduct and make-up of the
  SC, Working Groups and other bodies within the SC's domain

Many of these responsibilities will be delegated by the SC to appropriate
bodies such as the Working Groups.

## SC Members

TSC members are responsible for top level technical community concerns. The role
is mostly administrative and is responsible for admitting new Top Level
Projects, Top Level Working Groups, and advocating for any needs in the
technical side of the project to the OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors.

SC members can nominate new members at any time. Candidates for membership tend
to be people who have a competency for community management and a high tolerance
and patience for process minutiae as the TSC delegates most of its responsibilities
to other projects and working groups.

A [current list of SC members]() is maintained on the [website]().

## YouTube
Many teams/groups may desire to post videos to the [ToIP YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/trustoverip+foundation/). The creation and management of this channel requires the creation and management of a Google Plus account.

To request access, [open an issue](https://github.com/trustoverip/SC/issues/new).

Any GitHub team maintainer is allowed `Manager` access to the Google Plus
account allowing them to add/manage video content and schedule events
(live broadcasts).

Members of the SC are allowed `Owner` access to the Google Plus account. This
role can do all `Manager` activities and add/remove other members from the
Google Plus account.

>TODO: Establish process for ToIP Google Plus account.

## Strategic Initiatives

At any one time the ToIP Foundation project may have a number of strategic initiatives
underway.  The goal of the SC is to have a champion for each of these
initiatives and to support the initiatives in order to enable their
success.

## Top-Level WGs and Task Forces

* [Working Groups](WORKING_GROUPS.md)
* [Task Forces](TASK_FORCES.md)

## Policy Change Proposal Process

The SC is chartered to oversee the technical governance of all Top
Level Projects and Working Groups under ToIP. The SC
establishes the default governance, conduct, and licensing policies for all Top
Level Projects. Top Level Working Groups and Task Forces have broad powers of
self-governance.

To propose a change or addition to policies or processes that are intended to
cover all Top Level Projects and Working Groups in the foundation, a PR should
be opened in the `trsutoverip/SC` repository.

The pull request can be labeled `sc-agenda` to request that it be put on the
agenda for the next TSC meeting.
