# ToIP Foundation Working Groups

ToIP Foundation Working Groups are autonomous projects created by the
[Steering Committee (SC)][https://lists.trustoverip.org/g/steering-committee].

Working Groups can be formed at any time but must be ratified by the SC.
Once formed the work defined in the Working Group charter is the
responsibility of the WG rather than the SC.

It is important that Working Groups are not formed pre-maturely. Working
Groups are not formed to *begin* a set of tasks but instead are formed
once that work is already underway and the contributors think it would benefit from being done as an autonomous project.

If the work defined in a Working Group's charter is complete, the charter
should be revoked.

A Working Group's charter can be revoked either by consent of the Working
Group's members or by a SC vote. Once revoked, any future work that arises
becomes the responsibility of the SC.

## Joining a WG

To find out how to join a working group, consult the ```GOVERNANCE.md``` in
the working group's repository.

## Starting a Working Group

A Working Group is established by first defining a charter that can be
ratified by the SC. A charter is a *statement of purpose*, a
*list of responsibilities* and a *list of initial membership*.

A working group needs 3 initial members. These should be individuals
already undertaking the work described in the charter.

The list of responsibilities should be specific. Once established, these
responsibilities are no longer governed by the SC and therefore should
not be broad or subjective. The only recourse the SC has over the working
group is to revoke the entire charter and take on the work previously
done by the working group themselves.

If the responsibilities described in the charter are currently
undertaken by another WG then the charter will additionally have to be
ratified by that WG.

You can submit the WG charter for ratification by sending
a Pull Request to this document, which adds it to the
list of current Working Groups. Once ratified the list of
members should be maintained in the Working Group's
README.

## Bootstrap Governance

The process for creating a new WG is as follows:

1. [Submit a draft charter](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/How+to+Propose+a+New+Working+Group+or+Task+Force) to the SC.
2. Once the SC ratifies a charter the WG will inherit the following
    1. Access to a new ToIP GitHub repository using the convention: ```trustoverip/xxxxxx-wg````.
    2. Access to an appropriate LICENSE
    3. Starter templates for a [WG repository basics](https://github.com/trustoverip/admin/repo_basics)

      1. Governance
      2. Code of Conduct
      3. Moderation Policy
      4. Meeting Minutes

    4. Access to a markdown version of the WG approved charter.

The WG is free to change these documents through their own governance process, hence the term "bootstrap."
